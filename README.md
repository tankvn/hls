#HLSprovider

**HLSProvider** is an open-source HLS Flash plugin/player that allows you to play HLS streams. It is integrated with the following players :

* a home made **Chromeless** Flash Player, with js controls.
* **JWPlayer** free edition version **5.x**
* **JWPlayer** free edition version **6.x**
* **OSMF** version **2.0**
* **FlowPlayer** version **3.2.12**
* **http://mediaelementjs.com** (support being added here : https://github.com/mangui/mediaelement)
* **http://www.videojs.com** (support being added here : https://github.com/mangui/video-js-swf)
 
HLSProvider could be used as library to build a custom flash player using a simple SDK/API.

**HLSProvider** supports the following features :

* VOD/live playlists
	* live playlist are also seekable (also known as DVR playlist support)
* adaptive streaming (multiple bitrate)
	* manual or automatic quality switching, using serial segment fetching method from [http://www.cs.tut.fi/%7Emoncef/publications/rate-adaptation-IC-2011.pdf](http://www.cs.tut.fi/%7Emoncef/publications/rate-adaptation-IC-2011.pdf)
* configurable seeking mode in VoD and live
	* accurate seeking to exact requested position
	* key-frame based seeking (seek to nearest key frame before requested seek position)
	* segment based seeking (seek to beginning of segment containing requested seek position)
* buffer progress report
* error resilience
	* retry mechanism in case of I/O Errors
	* recovery mechanism in case of badly segmented TS streams
* AES-128 decryption
	* the algorithm has been optimized and should allow smooth playback on low-end devices
	* decryption is performed progressively during fragment download.

the following M3U8 tags are supported: 

* #EXTM3U
* #EXTINF
* #EXT-X-STREAM-INF (multiple bitrate)
* #EXT-X-ENDLIST (live / VOD playlist)
* #EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE
* #EXT-X-TARGETDURATION
* #EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY
* #EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY-SEQUENCE
* #EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME (optional, used to synchronize time-stamps and sequence number when switching from one level to another)
* #EXT-X-KEY (AES-128 method supported only)
* #EXT-X-BYTERANGE (because of Flash limitation, whole fragment will be downloaded. However the byte-range will be extracted correctly)

the following containers are supported:

* MPEG2-Transport Stream. each TS can contain :
	* from 0 to multiple audio streams (dynamic audio switch available)
	* 0 or 1 video stream
* AAC and MPEG1-Layer 3 Audio Elementary streams
	* as per HLS spec, Each Elementary Audio Stream segment MUST signal the timestamp of its first sample with an ID3 PRIV tag at the beginning of the segment.  The ID3 PRIV owner identifier MUST be      "com.apple.streaming.transportStreamTimestamp".

##How to use it :

download latest release from here : https://github.com/mangui/HLSprovider/releases

###chromeless based setup:
from zip, extract test/chromeless folder, and get inspired by example.html

###OSMF based setup:
from zip, extract test/osmf folder, and get inspired by index.html

###FlowPlayer based setup:
from zip, extract test/flowplayer folder, and get inspired by index.html


###Flowplayer customization parameters:

functional behavior can be tweaked by adding configuration keys :

	flowplayer("player", "flowplayer.swf", {
	// configure the required plugins
	wmode: 'direct',
	plugins: {
	httpstreaming: {
	url: 'HLSProviderFlowPlayer.swf',
	hls_debug : false,
	hls_debug2 : false,
	hls_lowbufferlength : 3,	
	hls_minbufferlength : 8,
	hls_maxbufferlength : 60,
	hls_startfromlowestlevel : false,
	hls_seekfromlowestlevel : false,
	hls_live_flushurlcache : false,
	hls_seekmode : "ACCURATE"
	}
	},
	clip: {
	...


* hls_debug (true/default false) : toggle debug traces
* hls_debug2 (true/default false) : toggle more verbose debug traces
* hls_lowbufferlength (default 3s) : low buffer threshold. when crossing down this threshold, HLS will switch to buffering state.
* hls_minbufferlength (default 8s) : minimum buffer length before playback can start, after seeking or buffer stalling.
* hls_maxbufferlength (default 60s) : maximum buffer length (0 means infinite buffering)
* hls_startfromlowestlevel (true/default false) : if set to true, playback will start from lowest non-audio level after manifest download. if set to false, playback will start from level matching download bandwidth.
* hls_seekfromlowestlevel (true/default false) : if set to true, playback will start from lowest non-audio level after any seek operation. if set to false, playback will start from level used before seeking.
* hls\_live\_flushurlcache (true/default false) : if set to true, live playlist will be flushed from URL cache before reloading (this is to workaround some cache issues with some combination of Flash Player /  IE version)
* hls_seekmode:
	* "ACCURATE" : seek to exact position
	* "KEYFRAME" : seek to last keyframe before requested position
	* "SEGMENT" : seek to beginning of segment containing requested position
